_It takes a competent multidisciplinary domain team to build a practical https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[bounded context]._

*It takes _years_ to grow a _competent_ domain team like you'd find at Google or some other https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech[FAANG], as such.* I know because I do this for ... decades, and I suspect you do too because you are here reading and connecting with me. _And in my experience it takes at least 9 months of carefully planned coaching to correctly launch a single Digital Transformation(DX) Dream Team(DT)_. Then, not all succeed, though many more call a (fake) victory.

Let's take *the insurance sector*, *_USA_*, top 50 companies in 2021. (I know, laggards, but there's a point to it) These 50 companies practically own the entire market in the US. Yet, 91% don't have a single bounded context (BC) in production. Forget about any machine learning, data driven, self-healing smart DDD microservices ... blah. 91% don't have an ordinary bounded context even *defined*, much less implemented anywhere in their business domain. That's 64% in EU for 2019 (I don't have newer data there). 4:1 - EU:US;

It gets better! ~96+% of Americans don't have an in-house team tha can make that BC. You read it right! - 1 company, maybe 2, can actually build it themselves and do so. OK, in EU that number is 71%. WOHA! Now EU to US is 15:1... _Same corrupt moldy business sector but vastly different capacity to change!_

So, what does that mean? One market inflection point and Americans buy insurance from European companies pretending to be American companies because rigid American companies have nothing good to offer to Americans? Dunno...

But I do know that one does not get all the answers from a single GitHub repo. Happily, one may get a sensible starting point and a useful journey. Like with all things worth living for - One needs to invest time and effort to succeed and gain.

The saddest part in this story isn't even the sorry future of American tech and then economy that we're all headed for. It's the fact that practical DDD isn't that difficult to master and apply correctly. It just needs a little wanting and willingness, a little dedication and time, and a whole-lot-a doing design and code together.

_We can start right here._
