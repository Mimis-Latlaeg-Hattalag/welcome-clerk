*What is this?!* -- see link:index.adoc[*_the documentation_*]...

'''

* `./gradlew` - with a good IDE you'll have _an 'in-IDE' execution arrow_ here
* `gradle clean` - having global Gradle intercept to wrapper clean out caches
* `gradle run` - this will launch the aggregate root to http://0.0.0.0:8080/

To get started with your own _Domain Driven Design Aggregate_ you may simply fork this repository and start exploring. This artifact intends to leave some breadcrumbs about. But this is not intended to offer a comprehensive tutorial on how to make a technology-driven business. This is just a hopefully sensible enough default starting point for you, me, us to make one's own journey in code over some business domain.

NOTE: This group of repositories only contains the archetypes expecting the consumer to adequately wield any end-to-end DDD/BDD process mastery.

This group of artifacts, labeled _rdd13 me th15_ ('riddle me this'), represents time and convenience based development from scratch and public sharing of reusable materials (typically known as `workup` s) based on decades of templating work at real customers'. _Basic documentation_ is included with this artifact https://rdd13r.github.io/welcome-clerk/[at the corresponding GitHub Pages Site].

In our professional world this aspect is the *_underlying crosscut concern_* - https://rdd13r.github.io/welcome-clerk/_pages/security.html[here is more on that...]

A 1922 clerk greeting customers arriving at the place of business is perhaps one of the most generic aggregates that can be imagined and implemented as a part of _virtual behavior discovery process_ and hence chosen for this repository seed template;  https://rdd13r.github.io/welcome-clerk/_pages/about.html[here is more on aggregates...]

== Practicality

_This aggregate can also be used in https://martinfowler.com/articles/break-monolith-into-microservices.html[breaking down a monolith] using the https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html[Strangler Fig App] approach, for example - see the xref:poly-ux/tx-react-web-client-deprecated/README.adoc#_2_wrap_it_with_gradle[imported and wrapped io.js example] in the *alien/* folder._

> _I am creating this one in my free time careful to not intersect with any of the archetypes that https://www.asei.systems/[we commercially create] for our customers._ So, this is just a personal https://www.scaledagileframework.com/spikes/[spike] chronicled through its completion ... *I'd be honored and delighted to share and collaborate with anyone willing and able to contribute!*
