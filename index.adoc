.One Legendary Hacker-Mentor's Wisdom...
[quote, Joseph Skrypoczka, paraphrased]
____
*Dastardly laggards, spared from pity, are stones found cast into the night* +
— one would best find to simply favor light ...
____

_{rdd13r}[rdd13r] often repeats this saying of his mentor, for he's regularly reminded of its importance +
in guiding teams towards pragmatic action.
In the context of software development, +
it serves as a reminder to focus on *minimalism*, *clarity*, *simplicity*, and *productive* efforts; +
the [.underline]#business assets#, rather than wasting time and energy on futile or resistant paths._

'''

== Who is this for?

*_Agile teams breaking down a monolith_*

This component is a starting point for learning how to create an **aggregate** (_as defined in {fowler-ddd}[DDD]_). +
Once this component is useful and well-received, the domain team may choose to _template_ it, +
turning `this` clerk into an {wiki-archetype}[*archetype*^] for reuse across the organization. +
This '{fowler-ddd-aggregate}[*aggregate*^]' is a specialized microservice that automates business behaviors, +
much like a job description defines the role of a person in an organization.

Breaking down a monolith leads to the creation of aggregates. +
{event-storming}[*Event storming*^] ceremonies help teams model business behaviors, +
such as those in a restaurant, where actors like waiters, cooks, +
and bartenders have clearly defined roles.
These roles +
are the _job descriptions_ we aim to automate!

=== Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language

The {jungian-archetypes}[_common understanding_] that gives these "job descriptions" +
their meaning exists within the {fowler-bc}[**bounded context**]. +
Within the bounded context, actors have specific business terms +
tied to clear behaviors and outcomes.
However, **across boundaries**, +
the same words may represent *_different_* concepts, +
creating distinct vocabularies, or vernaculars.


== What really happens here?!

In 2024, survival depends on automating business processes effectively. +
But more important than 'what' we automate is 'who' does the automating. +
It’s not an external group disconnected from the business -- it’s a multidisciplinary team, +
embedded directly in the business.
Most importantly, the key to successful automation +
is **how** we approach it -- from the inside out.
At its core, this process is about +
continuously working ourselves out of work -- constantly refining, simplifying, +
and automating as we go.

Organizations that don’t understand this struggle to survive in today's competitive landscape.
