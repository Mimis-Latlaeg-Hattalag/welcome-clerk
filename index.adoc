.One Legendary Hacker-Mentor's Wisdom...
[quote, Joseph Skrypoczka, paraphrased]
____
*Dastardly laggards, spared from pity, are stones found cast into the night* +
â€” one would best find to simply favor light ...
____

_{rdd13r}[rdd13r] often repeats this saying of his mentor, for he's regularly reminded of its importance +
in guiding teams towards pragmatic action.
In the context of software development, +
it serves as a reminder to focus on *minimalism*, *clarity*, *simplicity*, and *productive* efforts; +
the [.underline]#business assets#, rather than wasting time and energy on futile or resistant paths._

'''

== Whom is this for?

*_Agile teams breaking down a monolith_*

This component serves as a seed learning trail for creating an **aggregate** (_as defined in {fowler-ddd}[DDD]_.) +
Once this component is useful and well-received, the domain team may choose to *_template_* it, +
extracting `this` clerk into an {wiki-archetype}[*archetype*^], promoting reuse across the organization. +
This '{fowler-ddd-aggregate}[*aggregate*^]' is a specialized microservice that automates related business behavior, +
much like a person's job description defines their role within an organization.

Decomposing a monolith leads to the creation of aggregates. +
{event-storming}[*Event storming ceremonies*^] help produce models of business behavior, +
such as in a restaurant, where actors like waiters, cooks, and bartenders +
have *_meaningful job descriptions_*.
That is what we must automate!

=== Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language

The {jungian-archetypes}[_implicit commonality of understanding_] that gives *_these_* "job descriptions" +
a concrete meaning is the {fowler-bc}[**bounded context**].
Within a bounded context, +
actors have specific behaviors and outcomes for business terms tied to $$. +
**Across boundaries**, however, the same words represent *_different_* concepts, +
creating a distinct vernacular, (i.e., language).
For example, let's imagine +
what `order` means to a _waiter_ and a _cook_.

Word `order` is a business term used by both _the cook_ and _the waiter_, but each of the two +
interprets it differently.
To a waiter, the `order` involves menu items, prices, the table number, +
and the dining experience.
For the cook, the `order` represents specific food preparation +
preferences like how the steak should be cooked, ingredients, recipes, techniques, and so on.

This common understanding between all waitstaff constitutes their _**ubiquitous language**_, +
but this language differs from that used in the kitchen.
And so, we have crossed the boundary.

== What really happens here?!

Getting with the times in 2024 what we do to survive is automating the business processes. +
More importantly than 'what' is 'who' automates the business.
And it's not some posy that's +
external to the business, it's a multidisciplinary _team injected right into_ the business. +
And most importantly is 'how' we automate our business -- from inside out. +
Essentially, continuously working ourselves out of work.

Companies that don't get this don't make it.

== This journey is creating one such clerk end-to-end.

_So, roll up your sleeves and link:docs/[let's get started]._

=== Hands-On Learning

This repository is NOT for those looking to copy-paste code without understanding 'why'.::

The purpose here is to encourage hands-on learning, where we fish for knowledge, not just results. +
We aim to deepen our understanding of **Domain-Driven Design**, **aggregates**, and **bounded contexts** as applied in real-world systems.
And we do so by building this **welcome clerk**, one such real world system.
