.One late Hacker's wisdom...

*Dastardly laggards, spared from pity, are stones found cast into the night* +

Whom is this for -- _Agile teams breaking down a monolith_.::

This component is a seed learning trail for creating an **aggregate** (_of {fowler-ddd}[DDD], of course_.) +
Once useful and well-received, the domain team may elect to *_template_* this component, +
_extracting `this` clerk_ into an {wiki-archetype}[*archetype*^] promoting reuse elsewhere in the organization. +
This '{fowler-ddd-aggregate}[*aggregate*^]' is a special microservice that automates related business behavior, +
akin to a person's job description.
Decomposing a monolith teams creates aggregates.
+
{event-storming}[*Event storming ceremonies*^] produce models of business behavior,
such as in a restaurant, +
where actors like waiters, cooks, and bartenders have meaningful job descriptions. +
The _implicit commonality of understanding_ that gives these "job descriptions" a concrete meaning +
is the {fowler-bc}[**bounded context**].
Within the boundary, actors have concrete meanings for business words. +
And these meanings _**change** across the **boundary**_. +
+
For example, the word `order` is a [.underline]#_business term_# that both _the cook_ and _the waiter_ use, +
but to each this term means a bit of different thing!
To a waiter the _implicitly understood_ `order` +
is a collection of menu items, the prices (and expected tip perhaps), as well as the table number, +
size of the party, and choices like "should the food be held and brought to the table together." +
The cook, of course, can care less for seating arrangements and wants to see is the stake requested rare. +
This common language between all waiters and bartenders is called _the **ubiquitous language**_. +
People in the kitchen have their own ubiquitous language, which is different from the dining room.
+
*_Alluring canonical concepts emerge when we attempt to automate the said restaurant!_* +
Regardless of the extent of the automation, be it the total remake where the waiter is a cute robot, +
or partial where a human is augmented with some software -- *_the domain does not change!_* +
Domain is a human concept after all, i.e., restaurant business of the hospitality industry; +
aggregates are the old employees, wholly or in part -- but where is the engineering team?!
+
As it turns out, the engineering team as a whole, i.e., developers, business experts, support staff, +
the waiters and the cooks -- are all part of the domain.
These extended multidisciplinary teams +
are injected into business and NOT the other way around!
_This is the part that amateurs always +
get wrong to the great detriment of the entire business_!
But once corrected, _the **{fowler-ul}[ubiquitous language]**_ +
of the business is extended to the engineering teams and not the other way around.
+
There is so much more fun to this -- so dig into the code!

This is NOT for people looking to copy-paste the code not interested in learning 'why'::

Nothing here will give you a fish to fry because that is a waste of everyone's time. +
Here we are hands-on fishing for the knowledge instead.
